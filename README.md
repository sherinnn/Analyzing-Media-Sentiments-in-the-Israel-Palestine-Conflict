# Analyzing-Media-Sentiments-in-the-Israel-Palestine-Conflict
In this project we aim to dissect and understand the sentiments and biases present in media representations of this enduring conflict. Through sophisticated data mining techniques and sentiment analysis, this project endeavours to unravel the complex tapestry of media narratives, offering a data-driven perspective on how the conflict is portrayed across various media platforms and regions.
We intend to leverage a rich array of data sources, including the Kaggle dataset 'Google War News'. Further, we plan to utilise NewsAPI (https://newscatcherapi.com/) and social media platforms like Facebook's CrowdTangle and the Twitter API to track pertinent information. 

## Problem Statement
To investigate and quantify the sentiments and biases in media coverage of the Israel-Palestine conflict across diverse media outlets.
