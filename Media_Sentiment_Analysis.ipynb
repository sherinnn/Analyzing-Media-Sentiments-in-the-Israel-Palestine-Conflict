Semantics can be a textual feature: buy versus purchase.\n",

While it is unclear what an Israel led by its current far-right government, would be willing to concede for a deal with the kingdom, the Saudis and Palestinians have formulated two positions: the 'optimum' and the 'realistic.' \n",
            "The most direct public reference to the centrality of the Palestine question in Saudi-Israeli normalization talks came in a statement in June by the spokesman for the Saudi embassy in Washington, Fahad Nazer. Speaking on Saudi television, he said: \n",
            "'Israel has a lot of potential, normalization can do wonders â trade, cultural exchanges â but for that plan to happen, for the kingdom to take that step, we need that core dispute [with the Palestinians] to be resolved.' \n",

            "The 'optimum' Saudi/Palestinian position would be for Israel to accept the Arab Peace Initiative (API) of 2002.

The API calls for Israel's withdrawal from all lands Israel occupied in 1967, including East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in return for Arab countries' recognition of Israel. \n",
            "Anyone who believes Israel would accept these optimum terms is delusional. \n",

            " last week, where he met Chinese President Xi Jinping. Abbas was the first Arab President to visit China since the China-Arab States Summit of Riyadh in December 2022 â signalling the importance that China appears to be placing on the Israel-Palestine issue.\n",
            "The visit resulted in a leap forward in relations between China and Palestine. They agreed to a strategic partnership. Palestine will participate in Xi's Belt and Road Initiative and a trio of new plans that Beijing has unveiled in recent months â the \n",
            "Global Security Initiative\n",
            ", Global Civilization Initiative and the Global Development Initiative â which collectively aim to present an alternative model of international relations to Western liberal norms. The two sides also activated a range of economic plans targeted at increasing trade between them.\n",
            "All of this stirred speculation about China's new \n",
            "offer to mediate a peace process\n",
            " between Israel and Palestine, and whether it can succeed. So here's the harsh reality: Beijing likely won't be able to broker peace, yet could notch up a geopolitical win for itself by just trying.\n",
            "China's plan includes supporting full membership for Palestine in the United Nations as a sovereign and independent state with Jerusalem as the capital, the preservation of the status quo in Jerusalem's religious holy sites and the resumption of peace talks with Israel on the basis of UN resolutions. The aim: a 'two-state solution' to finally realise peaceful coexistence between Palestine and Israel which has been attempted for decades.\n",
            "But what's in it for Beijing?\n",
            "The growing Chinese interest in the Palestinian issue stems from several motives that are consistent with Beijing's broader objectives in the region and internationally.\n",
            "First, China is trying to build on its success in brokering a \n",
            "deal between Saudi Arabia and Iran\n",
            " to extend regional peace to the Palestinian-Israeli arena. China is interested in protecting its growing investments in the Middle East and helping end or curb conflict is to its advantage.\n",
            "Second, China is trying to become a global leader in economic peacemaking. Any progress towards solving the Palestinian-Israeli conflict would solidify that image, one of the objectives of its Global Security Initiative.\n",
            "Third, China is trying to disperse and counter Western pressure regarding the issues of Xinjiang, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Ukraine, by emphasising an issue of equal complexity and importance.\n",
            "Importantly, the final two goals do not necessarily require that Chinese mediation succeeds in bringing a lasting end to the decades-long conflict and struggle for Palestinian statehood. It can secure some of its ambitions simply by positioning itself as a champion of diplomacy and mediation.\n",
            "That's vital to remember because, despite its growing enthusiasm, China's ability to actually advance a peace process is questionable â despite the regional trend in the Middle East towards diplomacy.\n",
            "Israel's hardline government stands as the most decisive reason for this bleak outlook. For Israel, the occupation and the aggressive military and techno-authoritarian system of population control over the Palestinian people represent larger religious and ethno-nationalist goals that transcend basic state interests. It cannot be disabused of these aims with instruments of statecraft such as diplomatic arm-twisting or trade incentives.\n",
            "This conflict, unlike the Saudi-Iran row, is also not a conflict between two states on somewhat equal standing. It is between the occupied and an occupier who feels unchallenged and emboldened. Israel is even moving towards the \n",
            "further annexation\n",
            " of Palestinian land. The rapid growth of Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank has already rendered the two-state solution obsolete.\n",
            "For Palestine, China's growing interest still has clear advantages. By pushing forward the Abraham Accords with multiple Arab nations, the United States isolated Palestinians who cut ties with the US government in 2017 in protest and reduced their security coordination with Israel.\n",
            "In a recent interview with CNN, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said negotiations with the Palestinians are no longer a priority and the US-led Abraham Accords and peace with Arab countries will come first.\n",
            "As so, the Palestinians welcome Chinese leadership in negotiations to balance against perceived US bias in favour of Israel. Though the Palestinian Authority (PA) remains reliant on the US and its allies to sustain its economic survival, as Washington increases pressure on the Palestinians by cutting aid, Abbas and his administration need Chinese economic and development help.\n",
            "Nonetheless, for the moment Chinese aid and investment in Palestine remain insignificant. Questions about the PA's domestic legitimacy and internal divisions among the Palestinians also present potential obstacles to any efforts to kick-start negotiations.\n",
            "Meanwhile, the trajectory of Sino-Israeli economic ties does not bode well for Chinese leverage and influence with the Israeli government, either.\n",
            "China is Israel's third-largest trading partner globally. Trade volume increased from $50m in 1992 to $15bn in 2021. But \n",
            "US pressure\n",
            " on Israel to downgrade ties with Beijing, as part of its global competition with China, has changed this trend.\n",
            "In 2018-2022, Israel's exports to China stagnated at about $4.5bn. Between 2018 and 2021, Israel's imports from China also stagnated at $10.5bn. In 2020, Israel set up an advisory committee to inspect national security aspects of foreign investments â essentially to scan deals with China as potential national security threats, per the US's request. Chinese investments in Israel have slowed as a result and will continue to do so, undermining Beijing's ability to use trade to bargain for peace.\n",
            "All of this, undergirded by the refusal of the current far-right Israeli government to talk with the Palestinians, means it is unlikely the Chinese efforts will be fruitful in achieving peace between Palestinians and Israelis.\n",
            "Beijing is likely to continue to pursue mediation between Palestine and Israel as doing so is consistent with its own interests even if nothing is achieved.\n",
            "Great diplomatic accomplishments tend to take place when expert diplomats are presented with an exceptional geopolitical opportunity. That was the case when China managed to broker a deal between Iran and Saudi Arabia. While a diplomatic coup for China, the Iran-Saudi detente was a product of both nations reevaluating how their long-simmering enmity was impacting their actual interests. Many rounds of painstaking talks in Baghdad had already created fertile soil for this achievement.\n",

However, they have ended up worse than they were before Oslo. Moreover, Netanyahu's concept of Palestinian self-rule gives Israel the \"overriding\" power in all security issues.

Neither Israel and its allies, nor the Palestinian Fatah movement accepted the election result, and Israel under Netanyahu has propped up the undemocratic PA led by Mahmoud Abbas ever since.\n",

The underlying tone of such a comment from a person in power is particularly offensive to millions of people around the world, including the Palestinians whose land Israel occupies and whose rights, guaranteed by international law, have never been recognised by the settler-colonial state.

            "US president Joe Biden on Friday publicly committed to a two-state solution based on 1967 borders, but admitted 'the ground is not ripe at this moment to restart negotiations'.'The Palestinian people deserve a state of their own that's independent, sovereign, viable and continuous,' he told Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas in his address in Bethlehem in the West Bank. 'Two states for two people both of whom have deep and ancient roots in this land.'Amid a protest from Palestinians over the killing of Palestinian-American Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh, he promised 'the US will continue to insist on a full and transparent accounting of her death'.Mr Abbas stressed that this may be one of 'the last chances' to achieve a two-state solution. 'I am extending a hand to the leaders of Israel in order to make peace,' he said, adding that 'the path begins with an end to the occupation'.Earlier, during a visit to the East Jerusalem Palestinian Augusta Victoria hospital, Mr Biden again alluded to his Irish roots.'When I was a US senator my colleagues used to joke with me that I was quoting Irish poets. They thought I did it because I was Irish. I did it because they are the best poets of the world,' he said.He then quoted a familiar line from The Cure at Troy by Seamus Heaney: 'The longed-for tidal wave/ Of justice can rise up,/ And hope and history rhyme.''It is my prayer that we are reaching one of those moments where hope and history rhyme,' he said.Mr Biden flew to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, after his talks in Bethlehem, where he greeted the country's de facto ruler, crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, with a fist bump, despite a pledge to make Saudi Arabia a 'pariah' over the 2018 murder in Turkey of Saudi dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents.On Saturday, Mr Biden will participate in a summit of nine Arab states.Before Mr Biden's departure from Israel, Riyadh announced it was opening its airspace to all countries, meaning that for the first time Israeli planes will be able to fly to and from Asian destinations and Australia via Saudi airspace, cutting the flying time by hours.Saudi Arabia does not have diplomatic relations with Israel and has linked establishing ties to progress towards the establishment of a Palestinian state. However, informal ties have developed apace in recent years, particularly in the military and intelligence spheres, aimed at combating Iranian influence in the region.Israeli prime minister Yair Lapid thanked Riyadh for the decision which, he said, came after a long road of intense and covert diplomacy with Saudi Arabia and the US.'This is only the first step. We will continue working with necessary caution, for the sake of Israel's economy, security and the good of our citizens,' he said.White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said the decision paved the way for 'a more integrated, stable, and secure Middle East'.\n",

            "The United States suffers from a fundamental problem in its attempts to promote democratization in the Middle East. Unwavering U.S. support to Israel significantly accentuates its unfavorable image among an Arab public that is still recuperating from the atrocities of the recent Israeli attack on Gaza. President Biden's plan to promote democracy and support human rights in the Middle East will face longstanding concerns, serious doubts, and perhaps total rejection from pro-democracy activists and human rights defenders across the region. The Biden administration's plans to support democracy and human rights in the Middle East are well underway according to a spokesperson of the United States National Security Council,1 who said that the Unites States has begun to strongly encourage democratic reform in the Middle East through communication to the public regarding human rights violations and abuses of the rule of law. For example, the United States was among signatories of the joint statement issued by members ofÂ  the UN Human Rights Council, which called on Egypt to improve its human rights policies and procedures. The Biden administration has also expressed deep concern regarding human rights conditions in Iraq and has called on all Iraqi forces to respect relevant provisions of international law. According to the official, the Biden administration does not yet have a comprehensive plan regarding all human rights issues in the region, but it strives to evaluate the situation of each country independently.Â  The U.S. attempt to revive discourse on democratization raises questions regarding values and standards and how they will be balanced against long-standing strategic interests in relations with Arab governments. The United States faces two problems regarding the credibility of its proposal to promote democracy in the region: its policies on regional issues, such as the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and its bias in favor of ruling elites.Â  New Administration, Different Policies? The cynicism many Arabs have regarding U.S. policies toward the Middle East clouded the cautious optimism that some expressed upon Biden's electoral victory. This cynicism has unfortunately been confirmed by the strident U.S. defense of Israel and its 'right to defend itself' to the extent of blocking a UN Security Council statement calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, where Israeli use of excessive force led to the death of 230 civilians. Though several Arab states have signed normalization agreements with Israel, the United Arab Emirates being a case in point, an overwhelming majority of the Arab public disapproves of this form of diplomatic recognition. For many Arabs, these normalization agreements are not only seemingly in opposition to the Palestinian cause, but they also undermine one of the key incentives for Israel to end its occupation of Palestine. Additionally, the agreements allow Israel to continue building settlements that violate Palestinian rights. The 2019-2020 Arab Opinion Index, which examined public opinion regarding attitudes towards the Palestine issue across 13 Arab countries, showed that 88 percent of Arabs disapprove of recognition of Israel by their home countries, whereas only 6 percent support it. Half of those who supported recognition of Israel responded that it should be conditioned on the establishment of a free and independent Palestinian state. According to the survey, 66 percent of the Arab public considers Israel and the United States (a combined total) the two countries that pose the largest threat to security in the Arab world. Eighty nine percent of Arabs believe that Israel alone poses the greatest threat to the security and stability of the region. Gulf public opinion, as surveyed in the Arab Opinion Index, had one of the highest percentages of respondents who considered the Palestinian cause as an issue for all Arabs, despiteÂ  the recent push for normalization with Israel in the region. When it came to the fight against terrorism, 17 percent of surveyed Arabs suggested that resolving the Palestinian cause would be the number one solution for combating terrorism in the region, while 15 percent suggested ending foreign intervention and 12 percent said that supporting democracy would help in fighting terrorism in the region. When asked to examine specific U.S. foreign policy areas, the vast majority of Arabs had a negative outlook on the U.S. policies towards Palestine (81 percent), Syria (77 percent), Yemen (74 percent), and Libya (70 percent). The Biden administration would be remiss to disregard these numbers when evaluating plans to promote democracy in the region. The statistics demonstrated the degree to which Arabs doubt the United States' reliability as a credible and fair partner who is determined to take a more balanced position in the region. Failure in the First Human Rights Test President Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken have repeatedly stressed that advancing democratic norms and fundamental human rights 'will be at the center of U.S. foreign policy' in all the countries of the Middle East, including the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. According to the administration's official statement, the United States encourages all of its partners to make every effort to improve the way they treat their citizens and has taken steps to investigate and address human rights violations committed by Saudi Arabia. The investigation inspected both internal and external violations and the administration expressed concern over the arrests and ill-treatment of human rights advocates in the Kingdom, especially women activists. In a statement released on February 26, 2021, titled 'Accountability for the Murder of Jamal Khashoggi,' Blinken announced a visa restriction policy named after the prominent Saudi journalist and dissident. The ban targeted 76 Saudi citizens believed to have been directly involved in serious counter dissident activities or suspected of involvement in the murder of Khashoggi.Â  Â  President Biden, in a phone conversation with King Salman of Saudi Arabia, affirmed 'the importance the United States places on universal human rights and rule of law' and 'noted positively' the release of several Saudi activists, including prominent Saudi women's rights activist, Loujain al-Hathloul. The conversation seemingly closed the discussion of the murder of Khashoggi between the two governments, as no public reference has been made to the role of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in this flagrant violation of human rights. Even the U.S. State Department's human rights report, despite its strong and comprehensive coverage of the violations in Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries, did not name Bin Salman in conjunction with the \"killing of Khashoggi.\"Â  The Biden administration's decision to forgo direct sanctions on the Crown Prince reinforces the belief that many Arabs have that the United States has no scruples in granting immunity to perpetrators of human rights violations if they are members of the ruling elite and royal families. The United States continues to fail the test of impartiality when it comes to its strategic partners in the region.Â  Arab Spring Revolutions and Democracy Promotion The 2011 Arab Spring protesters aspired to create more democratic societies where people's voices were heard, an aspiration still pursued by democratic human rights activists who question the U.S. plan to support democratization and human rights in the Middle East and believe that the real test for Washington comes when this ideal clashes with American interests in the region. In the 2019-2020 Arab Opinion Index, 89 percent of the surveyed participants viewed democracy positively. An average of 39 percent defined democracy as safeguarding citizens' political and civil liberties, 20 percent viewed it as the guarantee of equality and justice for citizens, 12 percent affirmed the participation and institutional aspect of a democratic system (circulation of power, separation, and control between authorities), and the majority rejected the statement that their society is not prepared to practice democracy. Although 79 percent of Arab public opinion considers a democratic system to be the most appropriate for their countries, the ruling elite in many Arab countries still oppress, imprison, and exile those who demand it. Autocratic regimes continue to justify their repressive practices; however, with the idea that Arab people are not yet ready to practice democracy, pointing to the negative repercussions of the Arab Spring in Libya, Syria, and Yemen. In assessing citizens' views on the 2011 Arab uprising, however, 58 percent consider the uprisings to have been positive. This percentage from the 2019-2020 poll is the highest ever since the question was first included in the 2012-2013 survey. Furthermore, 51 percent of Arab citizens stated that they would accept an electoral victory that resulted in a rise to power of a political party with which they disagreed, while 43 percent stated that they would not. These statistics clearly show that the majority of Arab people support democracy and that they might even encourage and support an American plan to promote democracy as a solid political base for their governments.Â  If the Biden administration is serious about pushing this plan, it must adopt a new strategy that does not rely solely on the support of long-term autocratic allies. The Unites States should attempt to create a strong new network of allies, who represent civil society and advocate for individual and public freedoms under the rule of law. The time has passed for paying lip service to democratic ideals and human rights in the Middle East; signing joint statements and expressing concerns over human rights violations is no longer good enough. It is time for this administration to review its positions and policies on key Arab issues and conflicts, and work to build new strategic partnerships that are not limited to ruling elites and royal families.

In a complete turnaround, King Salman's forward-acting son, the Crown Prince & Prime Minister Mohammad Bin Salman (MBS), expressed his affinity towards Israel, not because Saudi Arabia âneeds' Israel but because he sees Israel as an equal in the region. MBS has noticed that Israel recognizes the West is no longer a superpower, and it has, in many instances, sided with the emerging Eastern power bloc of Russia, India, and China. In the nearly five years of MBS' leadership, he has carried on a diplomatic âaffair' with Israel, all without a normalization deal.

On a personal note, I visited Jeddah eight months ago on a non-Jewish tour. Our Saudi tour guide, without being prompted, explained that Jerusalem is not important to Islam and that their holy sites are located within the Kingdom. Towards that end, Saudi Arabia allowed a Twitter (now X) campaign emanating from several citizens to \n",
            "explain that the Temple Mount belongs to Jews\n",
            ". Muslim Zionists in Morocco began to re-share those tweets. On a larger scale, Israel and the Saudis have been sharing military intelligence for years. \n",
            "Now that a potential deal is most certainly to materialize, major concern is emerging that the Saudis are demanding a separate âstate' for the Arabs under the control of the PA and Gazans; and for the eastern portion of Jerusalem, which includes the Jewish Quarter, to be its capital. Nevermind that there already exists an Arab state within the region of Palestine, and has, since Churchill stole 78% of the Jewish homeland in 1922; it is called Jordan. These unrealistic concession requests/threats have the fingerprints of self-hating Jewish groups who surround Biden (IfNotNow, Jewish Voice for Peace, JStreet) and are behind most of his antisemitic policies against Israel (refunding UNRWA, of which Hamas skims 10%, refunding the terrorist PA, which engages in pay-for-slay tactics), since occupying office, and who applauded reduced sanctions on Iran, among other anti-Israel actions. \n",
            "Or, the Saudis are posturing in front of other Muslim nations on the world stage, as a front, but doubtful that the anti-Israel demands are coming from their side alone. During the Abraham Accords talks, the Saudis, \n",
            "who control the Gulf region\n",
            ", did not mention Gazans, Israeli Arabs who live under the PA, or any other Arab group lumped into the false-termed âPalestinians' once. When the U.S embassy was moved to Jerusalem, the Saudis did not find fault with the action nor was there any mention of the above-named groups. When it comes to Arab culture, actions are far more important than words. For years, Arafat was lying to Westerners that he seeks peace; in reality, his actions launched deadly intifadas against Israeli Jews. \n",
            "In the case of the Saudis, as of late, they are more a friend to Israel than the U.S and the EU are currently, without a deal. A formal treaty cannot be secured if an inch of Israeli territory is to be compromised, and/or if it is based on antisemitic revisionist history. A united Jerusalem remains the capital, and no terrorist âsecond' Arab state within Israel; all of Judea & Samaria is geographically within Israel and is historically and legally upheld as Jewish land. PM Netanyahu and MBS have the relationship to engage in talks directly; adding in the U.S will lead nowhere positive for Israel if Israel caters to antisemitic demands. I still have some lingering faith in Netanyahu that he will not succumb to concessions and that a historic deal will be reached. Israel, under any leadership would greatly benefit from stepping away from U.S involvement in its future diplomatic efforts with any country. There is no need for Israel to always be pressured by the U.S to betray its Jewish indigenous roots.\n",

            "As fighting between Israel and Palestinians in Gaza broke furiously into its seventh day, foreign ministers in the Security Council today called unequivocally for an immediate end to the bloodshed, sounding alarm bells over the imminent potential for the violence to spill into the wider region. In opening remarks, United Nations Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres described the hostilities as 'utterly appalling'.Â  The events have caused unconscionable death, immense suffering and damage to vital infrastructure.Â  'Fighting must stop,' he stressed. Â The United Nations is actively engaging all sides towards an immediate ceasefire. He deplored the increasingly large numbers of Palestinian civilian casualties in Gaza from Israeli air strikes, as well as Israeli fatalities from rockets launched from Gaza.Â  He also expressed deep concern over violent clashes between Israeli security forces and Palestinians across the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, where Palestinian families are under threat of eviction.Â  In Israel, violence by vigilante-style groups and mobs has added another horrendous dimension to the crisis.Â  Leaders on all sides have a responsibility to curb inflammatory rhetoric and calm the rising tensions. 'The fighting has the potential to unleash an uncontainable security and humanitarian crisis' and to foster extremism â not only in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and Israel, but in the region as a whole, he stressed. Thousands of Palestinians have been forced to leave their homes in Gaza to shelter in schools, mosques and other places with limited access to water, food, hygiene or health services, he continued. Â Israeli civilians, meanwhile, live in fear of rockets launched from Gaza. Â 'I am appalled by the attack on a refugee camp in Gaza, in which 10 members of one family were killed,' he said.Â  Humanitarian installations must be protected, and journalists must be allowed to work free of fear and harassment. Â He likewise denounced the destruction of media offices in Gaza as extremely concerning. 'This senseless cycle of bloodshed, terror and destruction must stop immediately,' he said.Â  He called on all parties to respect international humanitarian law and international human rights law, stressing that the status quo at the holy sites must be respected. Above all, he said the United Nations remains deeply committed to working with Israelis and Palestinians and with its international and regional partners, including the Middle East Quartet, to realize a lasting and just peace. Â Stressing that he is in contact with relevant interlocuters, he again called on the parties to allow mediation efforts to intensify and succeed. Â The only way forward is to return to negotiations with the goal of two States, living side-by-side in peace, security and mutual recognition, with Jerusalem as the capital of both States, based on relevant United Nations resolutions, international law and prior agreements.Â  'The longer this cycle of violence continues, the more challenging it will be to reach that ultimate goal,' he affirmed. Tor Wennesland, Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, said the past week has seen the deadliest escalation between Israeli military forces and Palestinian armed groups in Gaza in seven years, as well as dramatic scenes of violence across the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem.Â  In the Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood, there have been protests and clashes over the threat of Palestinian evictions by settler organizations.Â  Meanwhile, in the Old City, including in the Holy Esplanade, violent clashes have unfolded between Palestinians and Israeli civilians and police. Â Police deployed a heavy presence in the area in the context of large numbers of visitors for Ramadan prayers, protests and Israeli extremist demonstrations, leading to clashes. According to preliminary numbers, he said, 177 Palestinians and 10 Israelis have been killed by Israeli air strikes and Palestinian militant rockets.Â  Israeli official sources say that Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad and other militants have launched more than 2,900 indiscriminate rockets from Gaza towards Israel.Â  Nine Israelis, including five women and two children, and one Indian national were killed and over 250 injured.Â  Rockets have reached as far as the outskirts of Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and its suburbs, and Ben Gurion airport.Â  While a significant number of rockets were intercepted by Iron Dome, 450 fell in built up areas and many others landed short inside Gaza, accounting for Palestinian casualties.Â  Direct hits have been reported in multiple locations, causing damage to residential and commercial property, as well as a school and a crude oil pipeline. In Gaza, he said humanitarian and security conditions are more dire by the day.Â  In response to Palestinian militant rocket attacks that began on 10Â May, Israeli defence forces have conducted 950 strikes against what they said were militant targets, including weapons factories and depots, tunnel networks, Hamas training facilities, intelligence and security headquarters and offices and the homes of senior Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad operatives.Â  According to Israel, those strikes have killed more than 100 operatives, including senior commanders.Â  The civilian death toll also continues to mount, with Gaza health authorities reporting at least 44 children and 31 women killed and 1,200 injured as of this morning.Â  Over 34,000 people have been displaced from their homes. 'Such tragedies are unacceptable and cannot be justified nor measured,' he said, describing the deaths this morning of Palestinian families struck inside their homes, and of a five-year-old Israeli boy in Sderot and a father and daughter in Lod.Â  Warning that intensification of hostilities would have devastating consequences for both Palestinians and Israelis, he said the United Nations is working tirelessly with all sides to restore calm.Â  He reiterated the Secretary-General's urgent call on Israel and Palestinian armed groups to take immediate and decisive steps to de-escalate the situation and prevent any further loss of life.Â  While Israelis and Palestinians have a legitimate right to safety and security, 'the violence we are witnessing now is unacceptable and unjustifiable', he stressed. Describing rocket launches by Hamas and other militants from highly populated civilian neighbourhoods into Israeli civilian population centres as a violation of international law that must immediately cease, he stressed that Israel must also abide by the international humanitarian law principles governing armed conflict â including the proportional use of force and exercise of maximum restraint to spare civilians and civilian objects in the conduct of military operations. Turning to regional dynamics, he said that on 13Â May, Israeli defence forces reported that three rockets were fired from Lebanon into the sea off the coast of northern Israel.Â  Lebanese Armed Forces confirmed the firing and reported finding of material near a Palestine refugee camp in Rashidiyeh.Â  On 14Â May, up to 100 individuals protested north of the Blue Line, some waving Palestinian and Hizbullah flags.Â  The Israeli defence forces fired multiple warning shots, reportedly injuring two, and a Lebanese citizen later died.Â  In addition, three rockets were launched from Syria, with no reports of damage or injuries, and mass protests in solidarity with Palestinians also took place at Israel's border with Jordan. Meanwhile, he said, violence in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, continues to increase.Â  Since 10Â May, 19 Palestinians have been killed, including two children, and more than 4,000 Palestinians were injured by Israel's security forces.Â  At least eight Israelis were also injured in these incidents.Â  On 14Â May, violence escalated as Palestinians held a 'Day of Rage' in support of Gaza, with numerous clashes between Palestinians and Israeli security forces.Â  'This is the highest number of Palestinian fatalities recorded in a single day in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, since the United Nations began recording fatalities in 2008,' he said. Outlining the severe damage to infrastructure in Gaza, he said the lack of electricity has led to a decrease of clean water and sewage treatment affecting hundreds of thousands. Â The health system, already overwhelmed by chronic drug shortages, inadequate equipment and the COVID-19 pandemic, will likely be unable to meet the needs of those injured during the violence.Â  Since 10Â May, Israel's authorities have kept Gaza crossings closed.Â  Calling on them to urgently open crossings for the movement of critical staff and supplies, he said the situation also requires a pause in fighting to allow for a restock of supplies and an assessment of damages and needs. 'We cannot allow the situation to slide further into chaos,' he stressed, reiterating the Secretary-General's appeal for an immediate cessation of hostilities and his dire warning that this conflict will increase radicalization and extremism in the whole region.Â  He called on the international community to 'take action now' and enable the parties to step back from the brink.Â  The cycles of violence will only be ended by a political resolution which addresses the status of Jerusalem and other final status issues, an end to the occupation, and the realization of a two-State solution based on United Nations resolutions, international law and mutual agreements.Â  To that end, he reiterated his call on the Middle East Quartet, as well as on key Arab and international partners and Israeli and Palestinian leaders, to return to meaningful negotiations. In the ensuing debate, foreign ministers from around the world echoed calls for an immediate ceasefire and a laser focus on brokering the conditions necessary for a relaunch of peace negotiations.Â  Delegates were unified on the need for the Security Council to address the crisis, and for parties to strictly observe international law and end all violence against civilians.Â  Senior officials from Jordan, Egypt, the United States, the Russian Federation and France in particular highlighted the highest-level engagement of their Governments in those charged and fast evolving endeavours. Riad Malki, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Expatriates of the State of Palestine, said there are no words to describe the horrors his people are enduring, noting that only five months ago, Omar Al Hadidi came into life and will now grow old without his mother and brothers, ages 6, 8 and 14 â all killed by an Israeli air strike. Â He recounted other casualties, entreating Council members that 'when you embrace your children and grandchildren tonight, think of our children' and 'what it feels to see your world crumbling down'. Each time Israel hears a foreign leader speak of its right to defend itself, it is emboldened to continue murdering families in their sleep. Â 'Israel is killing Palestinians in Gaza, one family at a time,' he said, committing war crimes and crimes against humanity. Â It is unapologetic and relentless in pursuing its colonial policies. Â He asked what Palestinians are entitled to do to defend themselves, questioning whether they will receive support for investigations by the International Criminal Court â or deprived of a venue for justice. He likewise questioned what tools the international community is prepared to deploy to ensure Israel's compliance with its obligations and bring about an end to its occupation â tools it uses regularly in other conflicts:Â  military intervention, sanctions, the suspension of bilateral relations, prosecution of those who commit crimes, or imposition of an arms embargo, among them.Â  He wondered how Israel could believe that its troops, 'storming the holiest of sites, Al-Aqsa Mosque, on the holiest of months, Ramadan, and on the holiest of nights, the night of destiny,' would bear no consequence.Â  'We are not two neighbours living side by side in peace,' he assured. Â He described Israel as an armed thief who has 'entered our house and is terrorizing our family', claiming a right to security that it denies to Palestinians.Â  Israel is also a nuclear Power with a military arsenal, the Iron Dome and shelters, while Gazans are besieged. Palestinian civilians need protection, he emphasized, and they deserve compassion, solidarity and action. Â They are victims of dispossession, forced displacement, discrimination and denial of rights on both sides of the Green Line and in exile. Â Palestinians enjoy support from many nations that are informed by their own historic struggles for freedom and 'know oppression when they see it'.Â  He questioned the whereabouts of those who had proclaimed they had achieved peace in the Middle East by brokering agreements between countries that were not actually at war, or the real estate agents who claimed they could sell what they do not own. 'Jerusalem is not for sale,' he declared.Â  'Our roots are deep,' with Palestinian heritage etched into every stone, street and ally in the city. Â 'War and peace start from Jerusalem.' Â Saving peace starts with saving Sheikh Jarrah, protecting Al-Haram Al-Sharif from attempts to divide it temporally and spatially. Â The international consensus that the Council has helped to shape and defend is being destroyed.Â  'Act now to end the aggression and the assault on our people,' he said. Â Palestinian freedom is the only path to peace.Â  It is the Council's legal and moral duty to help achieve it. The representative of Israel displayed a photo of a 16-year-old Arab girl from Israel, who was murdered on 12Â May by the radical terrorist group Hamas.Â  Millions of Israelis have been huddling across Israel to avoid rocket fire.Â  Turning to Council members, he asked: Â 'What would you do if thousands of terrorist rockets were being fired at your country?'Â  It is far from the first time that Hamas has fired rockets at Israeli civilians, all while hiding behind Palestinian civilians. Â This time is different because the campaign is part of a premediated, malicious plan to incite violence and take power in the West Bank, ultimately replacing the Palestinian Authority.Â  Explaining that Hamas was frustrated by President Mahmoud Abbas' decision in April to postpone elections yet again, he said the group deliberately chose to escalate tensions in Jerusalem 'as a pretext to start this war'. Rejecting yet another pretext used by Hamas â accusations of meddling by the Israeli Government in a recent high-profile court case â he declared: Â 'Israel is a country of law, with a robust and independent judiciary.' Â It is well known that the Government does not interfere with court proceedings. Â Those accusations are false, and there can never be any excuse or justification for terrorism.Â  Hamas did not stop there, but instead went on to incite violence on the Temple Mount, as Palestinian extremists turned the Al-Aqsa Mosque into a site to stockpile weapons.Â  Showing a photo of stones piled up at that holy site, he said the Israeli police were able to use non-lethal means to disburse the riots without a single fatality.Â  'Israel deeply cherishes freedom of religion,' he said, noting that every year during Ramadan Palestinians are able to worship in peace. Â Once again this year, Israel took all possible steps to de-escalate tensions in Jerusalem, even re-routing its Jerusalem Day parade, but Hamas responded only by firing more rockets. For years, he continued, Hamas has built a vast web of underground terror tunnels that snake beneath playgrounds, hospital maternity wards and mosques, all in an effort to drive up civilian casualties when clashes do occur.Â  It attacks civilian infrastructure and buildings that house international media outlets.Â  Thanking the United States and all those countries that support Israel's right to defend itself from such acts of terrorism, he described Hamas' attacks â which involve attacking some civilians by hiding behind other civilians â as a 'double war crime'.Â  While Israel abides strictly by international law and takes extreme measures to protect civilians, their use by Hamas as human shield can regrettably lead to civilian casualties.Â  Against that backdrop, he warned against efforts to compare Israel and Hamas, stressing that the latter sees every Israeli death as a victory in its antisemitic plan and every Palestinian death as a success in its campaign to evoke international sympathy. Beyond the actions of Hamas, he went on to cite recent acts of violence committed by Arab citizens against Jews â including instances of lynchings â as well as by some Jewish citizens against Palestinians, all of which are totally unacceptable.Â  The current violence is a direct result of internal Palestinian political manoeuvring, he stressed, emphasizing that Israel has always sought peace and continues to do so.Â  He warned the Council against choosing to avoid condemning Hamas, which will only embolden a terrorist organization that seeks to wipe Israel off the map.Â  'Today, you can choose a different path,' he said, urging members to support Israel's heroic efforts to defend itself and dismantle Hamas' terror network, sending a message that it will not longer turn a blind eye to its human shield strategy. Ayman Safadi, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates of Jordan, said Israel is responsible for the difficult situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territories â and everything caused by the bloodshed.Â  'The hostilities must stop,' he insisted. Â 'The illegitimate practices of Israel must stop.' Â The Council must act now to protect Palestinians, he said, underscoring the impossibility of maintaining the status quo.Â  Lasting peace is a national and regional necessity.Â  Peace cannot be created through settlement activities, which are a grave and flagrant violation of international law.Â  Nor can peace be achieved by confiscating territory, forcing Palestinians to leave or by changing the historic status of historical sites in Jerusalem.Â  Stressing that the city and its holy sites are sacred, he said 'any attempt to undermine this area is provocative for 2Â billion Muslims.'Â  It is Israel's responsibility to protect the status quo in Jerusalem, as well as the Arab and Islamic identity of its holy sites.Â  The Council must force Israel to respect Sheikh Jarrah, he said, stressing that, according to international humanitarian law, the inhabitants of East Jerusalem are civilians and should be protected.Â  'We are talking about a war crime,' he said, citing resolutionÂ 478Â (1980). Â 'Let us call things as they are.' Â The occupation is the source of the conflict.Â  Peace and justice are diametrically opposed from this fact. Â International law must be respected, and resolutions must be implemented, including Security Council resolutionÂ 2334Â (2016). Â He called for a two-State solution that establishes a Palestinian State along 4Â JuneÂ 1967 borders, pursuant to the Arab Peace Initiative and various Security Council resolutions. Â The Council must launch serious negotiations aimed at ending the occupation and shoring up peace, based on the land for peace initiative that Israel is currently undermining.Â  'This inhuman occupation must disappear,' he insisted, stressing that Jordan seeks to work with the Council in establishing a just peace that meets the needs of all those living there. Sameh Shoukry, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Egypt, said the Council is meeting today after 70 years of ongoing tragedy for Palestinians and 42 years after the launch of the peace process, which at the outset was a hopeful one.Â  'This hope has little by little dissipated,' he said, amid the repeated failure to end the conflict.Â  Today, unprecedented confrontations are taking place against worshippers in Jerusalem, including Al-Aqsa Mosque, alongside a systematic policy against Arab citizens in Sheikh Jarrah in East Jerusalem.Â  He denounced prevarication around international legal promises, including for serious negotiations on the creation of a Palestinian State decided upon before 1967. Â Stressing that Israel's military operation has created victims in Gaza, jeopardizing peace and stability in the region, he said the Council must shoulder its responsibility to bring an end to the conflict and undertake efforts to deescalate the situation so that 'everyone can take a deep breath and think about the causes'.Â  The two-State solution is the only means for satisfying all the parties, he said, pointing out that the threats to regional stability did not appear over night, but rather stem from a climate of tensions perpetuated over years of systematic regression and the undermining of efforts to achieve peace in the region.Â  Citing the confiscation of land and destruction of institutions and homes, he said Israel's practices have even violated the holy month of Ramadan. Â 'Al-Aqsa Mosque has become a battlefield,' he said, stressing that Egypt, aware of its responsibility to its Arab brothers, has worked at all levels to achieve an immediate ceasefire and to protect the lives of innocent people, seeking to foster a return to the negotiation table. Â There is no other means to achieve peace and security than by establishing a Palestinian State along 4Â JuneÂ 1969 lines.Â  He insisted on the renewal and implementation of activities by the Middle East Quartet.Â  Egypt is acting with Jordan, France and Germany in the Munich context to foster a resumption of negotiations, he said, insisting that holy sites be protected â with Hashemite guards involved in those efforts â and urging more broadly that concessions be made as a price for peace. Wang Yi, State Councillor and Minister for Foreign Affairs of China, Council President for May, spoke in his national capacity, saying that the current situation first requires an immediate ceasefire.Â  The international community must do its part to ensure peace because without stability, the Middle East region will continue to face tensions.Â  The use of force only brings more hatred, and parties must cease hostilities, including air strikes and rocket launches that aggravate the situation.Â  Israel must exercise restraint, stop demolitions and end evictions.Â  Meanwhile, the State of Palestine must avoid steps that escalate the situation and must prevent civilian casualties and work towards a peaceful solution.Â  Turning to the grave humanitarian situation, he called on Israel to lift the Gaza blockade and facilitate the delivery of aid.Â  Efforts must support the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) in its critical work and avert a humanitarian disaster.Â  For its part, the Council must take strong actions on the conflict, reiterate its call for a two-State solution and do more to de-escalate the violence.Â  Regrettably, the obstruction of one country prevents the Council from speaking in one voice, he said, calling on the United States to support the 15-member organ in easing the situation, building trust and advancing a political settlement to the conflict.Â  The two-State solution is the way forward, he said, regretting to note stalled peace talks.Â  Recalling that this issue has been on the United Nations agenda for more than 70 years, he said the solution still remains elusive.Â  Expressing support for peace talks and the Middle East peace process, he invited the two sides to China to resume direct negotiations.Â  At the same time, the Council must do its part because the world is watching, he said, adding that 'we must practice true multilateralism' in finding a just solution to the conflict. Othman Jerandi, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Migration and Tunisians Abroad of Tunisia, described the recent escalation of violence as a serious threat to international peace and security.Â  As the main body responsible for protecting vulnerable people around the world from acts of aggression, the Council must not remain silent.Â  Reiterating Tunisia's position in support of the Palestinian cause, he also underlined its firm rejection of Israel's heinous attacks against unarmed Palestinians during the month of Ramadan and its ongoing efforts to change Jerusalem's historic status and demographic makeup.Â  Noting that the recent upheaval comes on the heels of an unjust court decision to evict Palestinians from Sheikh Jarrah, as well as efforts to bar Palestinian worshippers from accessing holy sites, he urged the Council to intervene by adopting a clear position compelling the occupying Power to stop its escalation.Â  Among other things, Israel must recognize the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and ensure that their rights under international law are fully respected.Â  'We must not treat victims and the aggressors equally,' he warned, adding that the region will never see peace and stability without a comprehensive solution to the conflict, based on the Arab Peace Initiative. Ine Eriksen SÃ¸reide, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Norway, reiterating the call for a de-escalation, condemned the rocket attacks by Hamas and other groups towards Israeli civilians and urged Israel to ensure proportionality in its response.Â  Appalled by the death of a large number of children, she said all parties have a duty to protect them, pointing to the hundreds of families currently being forced to flee their homes amid violence that has already damaged 35 schools in Gaza and 3 schools in Israel.Â  Turning to the 15Â May attack on media outlets in Gaza, she stressed that a free press plays a critical role in reporting from conflict zones and has a right to be protected.Â  Hostilities must end, she said, welcoming all efforts to achieve this and calling for rapid, safe and unimpeded access for humanitarian actors to bring in food, health services and other humanitarian relief.Â  As Jerusalem is sacred to three religions, Israeli authorities have a special duty to safeguard the rights of believers at the holy sites of East Jerusalem, she said, expecting also the rights of all residents to be upheld in accordance with international law. Â The events now unfolding in Gaza did not happen in a vacuum, and the international community must address the underlying issues of this crisis and such actions that are fuelling current tensions, including the risk of forced evictions in the Sheikh Jarrah and Silwan neighbourhoods in East Jerusalem. Â As repeatedly expressed by the Council, most recently in resolutionÂ 2334Â (2016), all measures aimed at altering the demographic composition, character and status of the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967, including East Jerusalem, are illegal under international humanitarian law. Â As long as there is no peace â no two-State solution â civilians will continue to suffer, she said, emphasizing the urgent need for renewed efforts to restart peace negotiations.Â  It is now vital that the Council speaks with one voice to address the situation. Simon Coveney, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Defence of Ireland, welcomed today's session while noting that 'we have already waited too long to express ourselves in an open meeting'.Â  He echoed the Secretary-General's calls for de-escalation, urging members to urgently send a united message. Â 'This is the latest tragic cycle in a conflict whose recurrence shames all of us in the United Nations and the international community,' he said.Â  Ireland knows first-hand that the most intractable conflicts require the greatest collective response, as well as responsible leadership on all sides.Â  He called on all the parties to refrain from violent and provocative acts â including rockets and incendiary devices launched from Gaza into Israel â while calling on the latter to abide by international law, particularly on the protection of civilians, even when acting in self-defence.Â  Underscoring the plight of innocent children caught in the conflict, he said Israel as the occupying Power is duty bound to ensure humanitarian access into Gaza. Â While the focus now is on de-escalation and avoiding civilian casualties, the global community must also ask itself how to move beyond the recurring cycles of violence and beyond business as usual.Â  'We cannot return to the flouting of international law, with the expansion of illegal settlements into occupied Palestinian territory,' he stressed, calling for serious and sustained efforts to reinvigorate and renew credible negotiations leading to a two-State solution. The representative of the United States, noting that the human toll taken during violence over the week has been devastating, said the numbers that may grow by the end of the Council's meeting.Â Â  Also expressing alarm over the violence impacting journalists and medical personnel, she called on all parties to ensure the protection of civilians and to respect international humanitarian law.Â  She expressed particular concern about protecting United Nations facilities, noting that civilians are seeking shelter in two dozen of them.Â  United States President Joe Biden has spoken with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Mahmoud Abbas, while the Secretary of State is working with senior Palestinian and Israeli and regional leaders.Â  The United States also remains intensely engaged with officials from Israel, Egypt and Qatar, as well as the Special Coordinator â to establish conditions for a sustainable calm.Â  In all engagements, the United States has made clear its readiness to lend its support and good offices, should parties seek a ceasefire.Â  Calling on Hamas and other Palestinian groups in Gaza to halt rocket attacks and other provocations, she expressed concern over intercommunal violence in mixed communities.Â  Parties must avoid actions including incitement, violent attacks, evictions â notably in East Jerusalem â and settlement construction east of the 1967 lines, as well as uphold the historic status quo of the holy sites.Â  Once the fighting subsides, familiar questions will arise over how to rebuild communities, alleviate the suffering of civilians in Gaza and focus on the needs of people in the region, especially for justice.Â  Prolonged violence will make these questions more difficult to solve and place the two-State solution further out of reach.Â  It is critical that all parties return to working in good faith towards the vision of Israel and a Palestinian State living in peace, within secure and recognized borders in which both peoples equally enjoy freedom and prosperity. Sergey Vershinin, Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, decisively condemned the use of force and violence against civilians in Israel and Palestine.Â  The armed confrontation must end.Â  He pointed to efforts by his country's leaders aimed at achieving that goal, citing discussions with the Secretary-General and high-level contacts with regional and international partners in that context.Â  The escalation stems from the absence of a direct negotiation process through which Israelis and Palestinians are meant to work out all final status issues.Â  He called on all parties to respect the status quo of holy sites, notably in East Jerusalem, and to consider their highly sensitive nature.Â  He condemned attempts to change the demographic character of East Jerusalem as null and void, stressing that the priority must be to a ceasefire and to stop the bloodshed.Â  Parties must comply with international humanitarian law.Â  They must protect civilians as well as infrastructure used by journalists and the media.Â  The issue of protecting medical personnel deserves particular attention.Â  Conditions must be created to launch peaceful Palestinian-Israeli dialogue, based on resolutions and the principle of two States living side by side in peace and security.Â  This requires the rejection of settlement activities, home destructions, evictions of Arab people from their ancestral homes and provocations of violence. Â He strongly reaffirmed the international legal framework for meeting Palestinians' legitima\n",

            "Home demolitions, evictions and the denial of citizenship are just some of the ways Israel has pursued its systematic policy of 'demographic engineering' over 54Â years, participants in the International Conference on the Question of Jerusalem said today, raising questions about how Palestinians can pursue justiceÂ â let alone live secure lives â in the face of international inaction. The International Conference â held in virtual format under the theme 'Forced demographic change in Jerusalem:Â  Grave breaches and a threat to peace' â was organized by the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People, with support from the Organisation of Islamic CooperationÂ (OIC).Â  It featured a panel discussion with community representatives and leading experts who provided an account of the situation on the ground and spoke to the legal, administrative and political arguments used to justify decades of Palestinian marginalization. The panellists included: Â Lara Friedman, Foundation for Middle East Peace; Michael Lynk, United Nations Special Rapporteur; Suma Qawasmi, Sheikh Jarrah community leader; Nivine Sandouka, Hoqoqna â Our Rights East Jerusalem; and Emily Schaeffer Omer-Man, Human Rights Attorney. In opening remarks, Rosemary DiCarlo, United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, speaking on behalf of Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres, said the theme is particularly relevant, as the forced displacement of Palestine refugee families in occupied East Jerusalem catalysed events that culminated in 11Â days of deadly armed conflict in May.Â  The Gaza war, the third sinceÂ 2008, claimed many lives, predominantly Palestinians, she said, noting that Palestinian protests, Israel's heavy-handed response and clashes around the Aqsa Mosque compound brought tensions to a 'whole new level'. The crisis is far from over, she said, describing Jerusalem as 'a powder keg', with those who are willing to play with fire.Â  She pointed to the provocative 'flag march' by extremist Israelis chanting racist slogans through East Jerusalem, which brought about new clashes.Â  She called on all sides to respect the status quo of Jerusalem holy sites venerated by billions of believers worldwide. 'Any threat or perceived threat to the physical integrity of the holy sites can have severe global repercussions,' she said, expressing hope that Israel's incoming Government will act responsibly.Â  She urged Israel to cease demolitions, evictions and illegal settlement activities, stressing that measures to change Jerusalem's status and demographic composition are without legal validity and should be firmly rejected by the international community. 'Ceasefires and a patchwork of interim agreements are no substitute for a permanent status agreement, which will end the conflict,' she stressed. Palestinians are not resigned to their fate of perpetual occupation.Â  She urged Israeli and Palestinian leaders, supported by a revitalized Quartet on the Middle East, to recommit to credible negotiations that address all outstanding permanentâstatus issues, ushering in the vision of two States, based onÂ 1967 borders, with Jerusalem as a shared capital and Gaza fully integrated into the future Palestinian State through a credible, time-bound national reconciliation process. Riyad H. Mansour, Permanent Observer for the State of Palestine, similarly pointed out that Palestinians â both in occupied East Jerusalem and throughout the Occupied Palestinian Territory â are facing massive aggression at the hands of Israel's occupying authorities.Â  This antagonism has extended to the neighborhoods of Sheikh Jarrah and Silwan and is indicative of Israel's ethnic cleansing of Palestinians within both the Occupied Palestinian Territory and Israel itself. If the international community is serious about adhering to international law and Security Council resolutionÂ 2334Â (2016), it cannot merely reiterate these principles while the occupying Power commits crimes with impunity, he asserted.Â  Questioning what is being done â after 54Â years of occupation â to defend international law and implement relevant Council resolutions, he called on the international community to act, rather than advocate for restraint as Israel kills civilians. Otherwise, he said, it is unfair to continue asking Palestinians to do certain things, as they are frustrated and resentful under the current abhorrent system of occupation.Â  'Enough is enough,' he insisted.Â  It is time for the International Criminal Court to expedite its investigation into war crimes committed against the Palestinian people. Cheikh Niang (Senegal), Chair of the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People, said Israel's settlement activities throughout the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem â including the neighborhoods of Sheikh Jarrah and Silwan â present a major obstacle to peace, threatening in particular Palestinians' rights to self-determination and return. He said Jewish settlers have been evicting Palestinian residents from their homes under the protection of Israel's security forces as thousands marched, yelling hate speech, to the gate of the Muslim quarter in the Old City.Â  He stressed that a two-State solution, leading to a longâoverdue Palestinian State with East Jerusalem as its capital, is the only viable way to achieve peace. Samir Bakr, Assistant Secretary-General of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation for Palestine and Al-Quds Affairs, likewise affirmed that the absence of dissuasive international measures has emboldened Israel to carry on with its violations.Â  He called on the international community to activate legal mechanisms to guarantee Israel's accountability and take all measures necessary to pressure Israel into honouring its obligations under international law. Emphasizing that Jerusalem has been an integral part of the Palestinian territory occupied sinceÂ 1967 â and that its annexation is illegal, null and voidÂ â he cautioned against taking actions that legitimize Israel's pernicious moves to change the demographic, political, legal and historical status of the holy city.Â  The Security Council must ensure compliance with its resolutions, halt Israel's settlement and ethnic cleansing policies, and thereby avert dire repercussions that could plunge the already volatile region into a cycle of violence. Panel Discussion Ms. FRIEDMAN emphasized that the events unfolding in Jerusalem are not new, adding that 'people tend to start paying attention to Jerusalem when things blow up'.Â  What is happening today has occurred daily, in various forms, sinceÂ 1967, when Israel took control of East Jerusalem and began its policy of demographic engineering after the 1967Â war.Â  These policies have ebbed and flowed over 54Â years, and along with them, international engagement.Â  The current reality is the logical and inevitable result of Israel working with ideologically motivated actors both inside and outside the country to implement a systematic policy of demographic engineering with total impunity. She said events in Sheik Jarrah and Silwan speak directly to the question of who has the right to return, noting that Israel's assessment is that Israelis can return to properties lost pre-1948, but Palestinians cannot.Â  The national narrative that 'God is on Israel's side' feeds into the irreversibility of its control over the city. Â InÂ 1948, Israel took possession of the western part of Jerusalem, whose Palestinian residents had fled or been expelled.Â  InÂ 1967, when Israel took over East Jerusalem, its Palestinian inhabitants could not be removed en masse.Â  'If you say you have sole sovereignty in Jerusalem,' she explained, it matters to be able to say that the population is Jewish majority.Â  Palestinians inside Israel afterÂ 1948 were given Israeli citizenship, but Palestinians in East Jerusalem were not, leaving them in the legal limbo of permanent resident status.Â  Palestinians born in East Jerusalem, whose families have been there for decades, today have the status of foreigners holding the 'privilege' of living there, which can be rescinded at any time. AfterÂ 1967, she said various means were used to take land in East Jerusalem, grounds that were then used for building Government-backed settlements.Â  'There is nothing accidental about settlements in East Jerusalem,' she said.Â  They were built to anchor the entire area to Israel through a 'DNA strand that can never be pulled apart'.Â  Later, the idea of 'greater Jerusalem' was pursued, leaving a huge part of the West Bank to be treated as such through policies that targeted Palestinian homes inside and around the Old City, with the Government working both legally and illegally with private actors to that end.Â  Today, the absentee property law is being weaponized to take land, along with the Jewish right of return, which is being pursued in Hebron and East Jerusalem alike.Â  Identification cards are being taken from Palestinians and housing limitations now prevent them from building homes.Â  While these and other acts over 54Â years have sowed enormous anger, resentment and hopelessness, they have not succeeded in pushing Palestinians out of Jerusalem. She described events unfolding today as a clashing of Israeli policies that are reaching their logical conclusion after 54Â years of impunity.Â  Because the international community only offers empty rhetoric, it would be irrational to expect Israel to behave differently.Â  'What is left?', she asked.Â  'Where do Palestinians go for justice?'Â  To expect them to pursue their claims in Israel's High Court of Justice is 'delusional', as the judicial body has proven over decades that it is unwilling to rule on the principles underlying Israel's policies.Â  Any small gains made have been achieved on technicalities, rather than because collective punishment is illegal and immoral, she said, underscoring a fundamental conflict between the rights of Palestinians, the obligations of international law and what is happening on the ground. MS. QAWASMI described events unfolding in the Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood where she lives as ethnic cleansing â and simply another chapter of Israel's modern military occupation.Â  The neighbourhood is home to 28Â Palestinian families who have lived there sinceÂ 1956, following an agreement with Jordan, which provided the land.Â  These families had been forcibly uprooted from their homes in historical Palestine inÂ 1948.Â  Following Israel's illegal annexation inÂ 1967, the neighbourhood has faced illegal claims of ownership and forced displacement, backed by Israel's discriminatory policies.Â  'We are trying to prevent settlers from taking over Palestinian homes,' she said, objecting to the unjustified use of force by Israel's Defense Forces to stop people from speaking up.Â  'We decided we are going to help our parents and grandparents keep their houses,' she said, stressing that the world cannot continue to turn a blind eye to Palestinians' basic human rights.Â  'We don't want to experience the Nakba again,' she stressed. Ms. SCHAEFFER OMER-MAN said the 100-plus legal proceedings over the years concerning Sheikh Jarrah can be roughly divided between the plight of those living in the eastern and western parts of the neighborhood.Â  In eastern Sheikh Jarrah, an agreement in place since theÂ 1980s created a protected tenancy for the Palestinians living there â not ownership rights â and while this may have kept many in their homes, it allowed their residency to be subject to the will of settler committees that have evicted many on procedural grounds ever since.Â  The western part, on the other hand, has been subject to a years-long battle to prove the status of the land, centered on competing claims of public ownership versus title granted to Jewish tenants by Jordanian authorities.Â  She said that the problem inherent in discussing these details is that it requires stepping into the Israeli legal framework, which treats the subject of Palestinian evictions as a real-estate issue.Â  This situation â rampant across the Occupied Palestinian Territory â is representative of a larger trend to rewrite international law out of the Israeli legal framework as that country fulfils a clear demographic policy through 'creeping legal annexation' that departs starkly from international law.Â  She called on the international community to support the International Criminal Court in its investigations into this issue and on States to ensure that private actors are not complicit in these practices. Ms. SANDOUKA, noting that the new Israeli Government's intentions towards East Jerusalem are still unknown, pointed out that the previous Government emphasized the Jewish element of Israel's identity and worked to eliminate any mention of Palestinian identity or narrative in school curricula.Â  Further, even though Palestinians comprise 60Â perÂ cent of the population in East Jerusalem, they have only received 30 per cent of building permits issued, and Palestinian neighborhoods have not naturally expanded sinceÂ 1967.Â  Palestinians living in East Jerusalem are considered residents â not citizens â so if they live or travel outside of the city for a period of time, or marry a person with Palestinian citizenship, they have their residency revoked despite paying taxes.Â  She also detailed the shrinking space for civil society actors in Jerusalem, pointing out that, sinceÂ 2016, Palestinian civil society organizations must report their sources of funding, and are subject to closure or prosecution if such funding comes from places deemed unfriendly to Israel or if they express a viewpoint critical of Israeli policies.Â  Underscoring that the United Nations has not assumed its responsibility to protect civilians in the Occupied Palestinian Territory â the 'cornerstone of any peace process' â she called on the international community to provide funding and the opportunity for advocacy, to hold Israel accountable for the poor living conditions in East Jerusalem and to support peace activists on the ground. Mr. LYNK said that, by looking at a map, one can see that Jewish Israeli settlements encircle Palestinian East Jerusalem, blocking off the Palestinian West Bank like a fortress, while a separation wall weaves in such a way as to maximize Israeli settlements and minimize the number of Palestinians living within it.Â  The Silwan and Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhoods are adjacent to the Old City.Â  However, Jewish settlers in East Jerusalem are citizens of Israel, while Palestinians hold permanent resident status â meaning they cannot vote and have no voice in what is happening around them.Â  Because it is so difficult for them to receive housing permits, their neighbourhoods are twice as dense.Â  Stressing that the goal is to make it demographically and politically impossible for Palestinians to return East Jerusalem as the capital of their own State, he said the Security Council and the General Assembly both have stated that East Jerusalem is occupied, that annexation is null and void, and that Israel's attempts to demographically change that area violate the fourth Geneva Convention, which forbids such confiscation of property except when rendered 'absolutely necessary'. Offering a legislative account, he said that, inÂ 1950, Israel's Knesset passed the Absentee Property Law, stating that Palestinians who fled during the 1948Â war cannot recover their property.Â  It then passed the Legal and Administrative Matters Law inÂ 1970, stating that Jews who lost their property in the 1948Â war can reclaim their property.Â  He pointed out that the tensions that led to violence in Gaza in May arise, in part, from these incessant claims by Israeli settlers in Silwan and Sheikh Jarrah, which have left hundreds of Palestinians facing the loss of homes they have had since theÂ 1950s, and thus, an insecure status.Â  Israel's courts do not recognize or apply international law, seldom protecting those who deserve protection under the fourth Geneva Convention and applying theÂ 1970 law in ways that validate their rulings.Â  He drew attention to Security Council resolutionÂ 476Â (1980), stating that Israel's occupation â then only 13Â years old â is already prolonged and that there is an 'overwhelming necessity' to end it.Â  The Council had condemned Israel's defiance of its own resolutions; stated that any proposed annexation of East Jerusalem is illegal, null and void; and threatened accountability.Â  If that was the case inÂ 1980, 'what are we to say now?', he wondered, stressing that the occupation is now indistinguishable from annexation and has acquired apartheid features. In the ensuing dialogue, the Committee Chair relayed questions from the wider virtual audience about why the term 'forced demographic change' is used more so than 'illegal occupation', and how to incorporate international law principlesÂ â and their violation of them â into the framework of the solution.Â  The session also heard commentary by several delegates, with Indonesia's representative underscoring the priority need to address Israel's occupation.Â  A solution can only be reached through multilateral dialogue and the revival of peace talks, he said, stressing that there should be no impunity for human rights violations. The representative of Egypt said Israel's continued unilateral measures â including settlement activities in East Jerusalem â jeopardize the two-State solution.Â  He called on Israel to uphold its obligations under international law and to offer protection to Palestinians from extremist Jewish groups.Â  Escalation of violence presents the need for a reinvigorated peace process and settlement of the Palestinian question, in line with resolutionÂ 2334Â (2016), the Arab Peace Initiative and a two-State solution.Â  He also underscored the importance of the United Nations in helping the International Quartet on Peace in the Middle East to advance negotiations. The representative of Turkey warned that, unless the causes of violence are addressed, fighting will reoccur.Â  She expressed concern over demolitions in Silwan and stressed that families in Sheikh Jarrah now face eviction.Â  She pointed to a Human Rights Council resolution adopted in May which established a commission of inquiry to investigate instances of repression based on national, racial and religious identity, underscoring the need to pursue all possible avenues for accountability. The representative of Tunisia recalled that administrative measures taken by the occupying Power to alter Jerusalem have no legal validity, expressing concern that looming evictions of Palestinians from Sheikh Jarrah and Silwan only are exacerbating the situation.Â  He called for an end to impunity.\n",

            "Note:Â  A complete summary of today's General Assembly meetings will be made available after their conclusion. Opening Remarks VOLKAN BOZKIRÂ (Turkey), President of the General Assembly, condemning the attacks against civilians and religious sites, called it heartbreaking that the escalation of violence began at the end of the holy month of Ramadan. Â Urging respect for all places of worship, including the Aqsa Mosque compound, he noted that the fatalities in Gaza include 63Â children and 35Â women. Â The situation in the occupied West Bank is also dire, he said, noting that civilians in Israel are likewise impacted, with fatalities and hundreds of injuries. Â Sending thoughts and prayers to the families of those who died, he echoed the call for a ceasefire. Â Israel, as an occupying Power, must ensure compliance with its international human rights law obligations, including proportionate use of force.Â  Pointing out that the insecurity that Palestinians experience has been exacerbated by the pandemic, he called for immediate humanitarian relief. Â United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near EastÂ (UNRWA) facilities have become refuges for thousands of Palestinians, he said, requesting Member States to ensure that the Agency, whose work is critical for regional security, receives support. The Palestine question, he continued, is the longestâstanding issue on the United Nations agenda and has been around as long as the Organization itself.Â  This latest escalation did not happen in a vacuum and cannot be divorced from the decades-long crisis, and the protracted military occupation of Palestinian territories. Â Coupled with the political impasse and lack of negotiations, such a sustained occupation has led to widespread feelings of hopelessness among Palestinians. Â Noting that the Organization's position has been documented in countless reports and resolutions, he said: Â 'We have to show the Palestinians and Israelis that there is light at the end of the tunnel.' Â The institutional record of the United Nations clearly prescribes the way forward â swift return to negotiations, with the goal of ending the occupation, addressing all final status solutions and achieving two independent, sovereign, viable States living side by side in peace and security. Â Stressing the role of ongoing negotiation efforts, including by the Middle East Quartet, he called on the Security Council to overcome its paralysis and demonstrate to the Palestinians that their legitimate aspirations will be heard. ANTÃNIO GUTERRES, United Nations Secretary-General, recalled the surge of deadly violence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory over the past 10Â days and reiterated his call for an immediate ceasefire on both sides.Â  The hostilities have caused serious damage to vital civilian infrastructure in Gaza, including roads and electricity lines, contributing to a humanitarian emergency.Â  'If there is a hell on earth, it is the lives of children in Gaza.' He said UNRWA is providing drinking water, sanitation and electricity generators for those sheltering in its schools, while the World Food ProgrammeÂ (WFP) has provided electronic vouchers to 74,000Â people in Gaza. Â In addition, he is working on an allocation from the Central Emergency Response Fund, and the Humanitarian Coordinator intends to release $14Â million from the Humanitarian Fund for the occupied Palestinian territories, he said. Â Israel has a duty to allow and facilitate rapid and unhindered access for humanitarian aid including food, fuel and medical supplies into Gaza. 'Even wars have rules,' he insisted. Â 'First and foremost, civilians must be protected.Â  Indiscriminate attacks, and attacks against civilians and civilian property, are violations of the laws of war.' Â He called on Israel to exercise maximum restraint in the conduct of military operations, likewise urging Hamas and other militant groups to stop the indiscriminate launching of rockets and mortars from highly populated civilian neighbourhoods into civilian population centres in Israel. Turning to the violent clashes between Israel's security forces and Palestinians in the West Bank, he urged Israel to cease demolitions and evictions in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, in line with its obligations under international humanitarian and human rights law.Â  With every day that passes, the risk that the violence could spread beyond Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory increases. Â The conflict creates an environment that is ripe for exploitation by radicals and extremists.Â  He said he and the Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process are undertaking 'extensive' diplomatic efforts with Egypt, Jordan and Qatar, and engaging directly with the parties to conflict â including Hamas â in efforts to secure an end to hostilities. 'We know far too well that violence begets violence,' he said. Â 'The unconscionable death, suffering and destruction of the past 10Â days only serve to push the prospect of sustained peace further into the future.' He called for resumed negotiations to address final status issues, as well as an end to the occupation, allowing for the realization of a two-State solution on the basis of the 1967Â lines, United Nations resolutions, international law and mutual agreements, with Jerusalem as the capital of both Israel and Palestine. Statements RIYAD Al-MALKI, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Observer State of Palestine, said that the current meeting is a clear message to Israel to end the massacre. Â Families are being targeted as they sleep, he said, and Israel is not even pretending it was a mistake. Â Instead of apologizing, Israel is asserting that it has a right to kill innocent people and then blame the victims. Â Noting the deaths of 230Â Palestinians and the destruction of 1,500Â residential apartments and 50Â schools, he said Israel also displaced Palestinians during the pandemic, despite clear calls against such actions from the United Nations. Â To those who say that Israel has the right to defend itself, he raised the question: Â 'What right? Â Israel asks, âWhat would you have done if missiles were targeting your cities?', but Israel forgets that the occupation is the root cause,' he asserted. Â 'How can an occupying Power have the right to defend itself when the people under occupation are deprived of the same right?', he asked. The Palestinian people are facing many disasters and nakbas, he said, adding that they have never let go of their struggle. Â Israel is attempting to displace forcibly Palestinian families from East Jerusalem in order to erase any Arab Palestinian presence in the city, with the compliance of the military and settlers. Â Pointing to the obliteration of the Islamic and Christian identities of Jerusalem, he condemned Israel's decision to break into one of the holiest places during the holiest month of Ramadan, during the holiest of nights of Al-Qadr. Â To those who were willing to make a peace that 'left Palestinians out', and were ready to make a gift of Jerusalem to the occupier, he said Palestinians responded that Jerusalem is not for sale. Â Reaffirming the cultural, legal and historical status of the holy sites, he said that Palestine has long accepted political and peaceful strategies to end the occupation. However, he added, the occupying Power has procrastinated since the Oslo Accords of theÂ 1990s and Israel's current Government does not believe in the twoâState solution. Â Dealing with Israel as if it is above the law only encourages it to act as such, he warned, urging Member States not to acknowledge the illegal status created by its policies. Â Every country in the world has a responsibility to hold Israel accountable, he said, calling on the international community to not just 'watch and idle'. Â Some accuse the United Nations of siding with the Palestinians when, in reality, it is siding with its own Charter and human rights. Â Condemning the former United States Administration's 'shameful deal that pretended that Palestine is not a relevant question anymore', he said the international solidarity for Palestinians demonstrates otherwise. Â Israel's criminal occupation has caused so much pain that the situation cannot be solved by a ceasefire, he said, recalling the stories of children in Gaza and West Bank, from Suzie who went to sleep with her family and woke up in the rubble, to Muhammad who now lives in a prison cell. MOHAMMED BIN ABDULRAHMAN BIN JASSIM AL THANI (Qatar) called on the international community bring an end to Israel's aggression against Palestinian civilians and protect the holy sites of Jerusalem.Â  Despite the condemnation of the international community in response to attempts by the Israelis to evict Palestinians in Sheikh Jarrah, those activities have continued. Â In addition, the numerous attacks on the Aqsa Mosque compound, with no respect for the Ramadan holiday, is a provocation towards millions of Muslims throughout the world. He said the use of disproportionate force and attacks against civilian populations, including in refugee camps, must stop immediately.Â  In Gaza, residential neighborhoods continue to be targeted.Â  When will the international community act to protect international law?, he asked, calling on Member States to ensure that the sanctity of holy sites is respected.Â  Inaction is undermining the authority of the United Nations and its ability to maintain international peace and security, he warned. AYMAN SAFADI (Jordan) said the conflict over the last 11Â days has displaced 75,000Â people in Gaza, most of whom took shelter in schools run by UNRWA, an agency that requires additional support.Â  Israel's practices push the region towards conflict, he cautioned, stressing that the occupation has turned the Aqsa Mosque compound into a centre for injustice, provoking millions of Muslims around the world.Â  Furthermore, Israel attempts to alter the demographic character of East Jerusalem with evictions, where Palestinians have a clear right to live in their homes and the occupation has no authority.Â  Jordan will continue to dedicate all its resources to protect the status and Hashemite custodianship of the holy sites in Jerusalem. If left unchecked, he said Israel's aggression will lead to more serious escalations.Â  There are now more than 700,000Â Israeli settlers in East Jerusalem and the occupied West Bank, a sharp and unprecedented increase over the past several years and one that undermines the two-State solution.Â  There will be no peace and security in a one-State apartheid regime, he insisted.Â  Instead, one escalation will follow another in a deadly cycle of violence.Â  Immediate action to address the root causes of the conflict is a both a strategic choice and regional necessity, he asserted. SABRI BOUKADOUM (Algeria), speaking for the Arab Group, recalled the graphic images of killing and destruction, and said that the Palestinian people's only fault is their refusal to accept occupation.Â  Is it possible to stay silent after counting the victims and witnessing the destruction?, he asked, cautioning against equating the oppressed with the oppressor. Â Pointing to irrefutable evidence of houses being destroyed while innocent civilians were sleeping, he said that the impunity given to the occupying force must stop.Â  The Arab Group believes that the Assembly must act quickly to reach a comprehensive cessation of violence against Palestinians and protect them and their holy sites. Â The gravity of the situation requires collective efforts, he said, pointing to the catastrophic humanitarian situation across the occupied territories. Calling for accountability for the crimes against civilians, he requested the Secretary-General to declare a state of humanitarian emergency to allow the international community to alleviate the suffering of the Palestinians and reconstruct Gaza.Â  'We have to start calling the occupation by its name,' he said, adding that the Palestinian question cannot be solved without ending that occupation, and allowing Palestinians to practise their right to selfâdetermination. Â Though Al-Quds Al-Sharif remains occupied, he said, Jerusalem will forever be the capital of Palestine. Â Reaffirming the historic and legal status of Jerusalem and its holy sites, he noted the many promises to Palestinians that were not kept, from the Madrid Peace Conference and the Oslo Accord to hundreds of Assembly resolutions and dozens of Council resolutions. MEVLÃT ÃAVUÅOÄLU, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Turkey, said that the world must not remain silent in the face of unspeakable brutalities and oppression against Palestinian people, because such a silence is equal to complicity.Â  Calling for a diagnosis of the root causes of the conflict, he pointed to the continuing Israeli provocations in Jerusalem, the desecration of the Aqsa Mosque compound and the forced evictions of the Palestinian people. Â All these acts of aggression took place during the holy month of Ramadan, he noted, adding that, not only high rises, but schools and hospitals were targeted. Â Not even the UNRWA buildings were spared, he said, noting the deaths of the Agency's doctors. Â A land of 365Â square kilometres with more than 2Â million people is a prison, he said. Â Noting the disturbing lack of action from the Security Council, he said:Â  'The world is bigger than five.' Â Recalling that the Assembly has adopted landmark resolutions in the face of the Council's paralysis, he pointed to the need for establishment of an international protection force for Palestine with military and financial contributions from the international community. Â Calling for a revival of a two-State solution, he said that the status of Jerusalem is an importan\n",

            "China has made several advancements this year in Middle East relations, the most notable coming in the form of mediating Saudi-Iranian rapprochement, much to the concern of Washington which still views the region as its own backyard. This week, the president of the PA, Mahmoud Abbas, embarked on his fifth visit to Beijing after receiving word that Beijing is ready to help mediate between the Palestinians and Israelis, stepping into a role that has previously been reserved for the US.\n",
            "Although Xi publicly declared his support for Palestine's '\n",
            "just cause\n",
            "' for statehood in June 2022, his nation has also maintained strong relations with Israel over the span of roughly two decades. Between 2007 and 2020 alone, China \n",
            "invested over $19 billion in Israel\n",
            ". Joint projects have spanned various sectors, including technology, defense, academia, telecommunications, and shipping. Beijing has \n",
            "invested in the Haifa port construction project\n",
            ", which is included as part of China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), in addition to Tel Aviv's light rail. This indicates that there are cordial relations on both sides; however, unlike the US government, China is prepared to support the Palestinian struggle publicly.\n",
            "Although it could be argued that China is biased due to its investments in Israeli infrastructure or its rhetoric towards the cause of Palestinian statehood, it is clear that there is somewhat of a more balanced approach to this issue than what is coming from Washington. The US has viewed Israel as its Western outpost in the Middle East since 1967, and the American's are so incredibly committed to Tel Aviv that US President Joe Biden has repeatedly stated that he subscribes to the nationalist ideology behind Israel's creation â Zionism. \n",
            "The White House is committed to financing, in addition to diplomatically and militarily backing, Israel unconditionally. Even when the interests of the US government are compromised, Tel Aviv is protected and let off the hook for its violations of American red lines. On the other hand, the US government offers financing to the Palestinian Authority (PA) that is based in one of the Israeli occupied territories, yet considers almost every other Palestinian political entity to be a terrorist organization, including Hamas that governs the Gaza Strip and enjoys the most public support of any party in Palestine. The US even helped conspire to overthrow the democratically elected Hamas government in Gaza in 2007.\n",
            "The US has failed to bring the Palestinian Authority and Israel to the table for dialogue on a Two State solution model â which is supported by the overwhelming majority of UN member states â since 2014. It has also watched as Israeli settlements have expanded, violating its own red lines in the conflict, partially leading to the political climate that currently exists under today's far-right Israeli coalition, which includes policy makers who are themselves hardline settlers.\n",
            "China on the other hand does not take clear cut sides. It supports the international consensus for the resolution of the conflict and could start its dealings with a clean slate. In addition, Beijing not only refuses to isolate other Palestinian political groups like Hamas, the PFLP and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), but has actively engaged with leaders belonging to the Hamas party. This means that the Chinese government would be able to speak to Palestinian leaders who do enjoy mass support, unlike the US.\n",
            "However, the current problem is that there is no resolution to the conflict on the table. The first step towards ensuring any viable political roadmap is achieving a unified Palestinian political platform, which must involve both the Fatah party which partially runs affairs inside the West Bank and Hamas which governs the Gaza Strip. On the Israeli side, they must also be forced to come to the table and China would have to muster staunch opposition to violations of its red lines, aimed at cutting Tel Aviv down to size and ensuring cooperation. Benjamin Netanyahu's current government would fall apart if it was to consider entertaining dialogue on a two-state solution, as a large portion of its ministers support annexing the West Bank, ethnically cleansing the Palestinians and even changing the status quo at Jerusalem's holy sites.\n",
            "Due to current circumstances, there are two tangible objectives that Beijing could work towards: Palestinian unity and diminishing US power in the country. Whether we talk about One State or Two States, there can be no agreement on a solution to the conflict if there is no unified authority or representative body on the Palestinian side. At this moment, the internationally recognised Palestinian president is Abbas, who presides over the Palestinian Authority's limited enclaves of control inside the Israeli occupied West Bank. Abbas has seized complete control over the PA's legislative and security wings since taking office and has outlawed democratic elections since the historic Hamas victory in the 2006 legislative elections.\n",
            "In order for the Palestinians to strive towards any solution, there must be a unified leadership that spans the West Bank and Gaza Strip at the very minimum. The situation will not change as long as there are two separate leaderships in power in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. One solution to the deadlock is for Beijing to convince Abbas to hold legislative and presidential elections. In theory, this would deliver a democratic solution to the question of leadership. Although it is no easy task, especially as the US, Israel and their other Western partners will strongly oppose the inevitable results of the elections should they take place.\n",
            "All recent polling data suggests that the majority of Palestinians oppose Abbas as leader and \n",
            "call on him to resign\n",
            ". \n",
            "Polling data\n",
            " and anecdotal evidence also suggests that the majority of Palestinians would vote for Hamas in a legislative election and a Fatah Party figure \n",
            "such as Marwan Barghouti\n",
            " in the presidential elections.\n",
            "Then there is the other element to China's potential involvement, that being its ability to influence the Israeli government. It is a far cry to suggest that Beijing would be capable of convincing Israel to agree to any solution with the Palestinians at this point, but it could absolutely test the limits of the Israel-US relationship and force Tel Aviv to take a more concrete position as to whether it is a Western nation or actually seeks to integrate into the Middle East. \n",
            "As the US government seeks to counter China's BRI with its own Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII), it does so while navigating a world in which its key allies find themselves part of both spheres of influence. During the Trump administration, American secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, \n",
            "expressed his concerns\n",
            " over the potential security risks posed by Chinese investment in Israel, even going as far as stating that Washington may have to reconsider some of its \n",
            "cooperation initiatives\n",
            " with the Israelis over it.\n",
            "Considering the \n",
            "Lavi fighter jet debacle of the 1990's\n",
            ", the US government may be faced with legitimate concerns in its security sector over Chinese-Israeli cooperation. The incident involved allegations that Israel's then fully nationalized weapons industry had transferred fourth generation fighter jet technology, from a scrapped joint US-Israeli project, to China, enabling the birth of the J-10 fighter jet. Although it is unlikely such a thing would happen today, in the New Cold War environment, the US will not want to see one of its closest allies lean too close to their top global opposition.\n",
            "Considering the scale of Chinese investment in Israel, it is possible that Beijing could push its weight around and pressure Tel Aviv towards taking certain positions that may come at the expense of the US. We see that despite Beijing blowing a hole in the strategy to achieve a future normalization deal with Saudi Arabia, through its role in negotiating peace with Iran, Israel still continues on as a partner of China. Beijing also carries considerable influence through its relations with Iran, the UAE, and even the likes of Syria and Lebanon to a lesser extent. All of this places the Chinese government in a more powerful position regionally. Consequently, it gives Beijing the ability to maneuver as a potential middleman, especially given the fact that it does not have the gruesome record held by the United States.\n",
            "Even the public announcement that China is seeking to enter the Palestine-Israel negotiating scene in a meaningful way, is a major blow for Washington, since it lacks the real influence or neutrality to create any headway towards peace. By strategically applying pressure on the Israeli government, in addition to aiding a unification of the Palestinian political scene, Beijing can indeed make some progress and not just demonstrate the diminishing role of the US.\n",
